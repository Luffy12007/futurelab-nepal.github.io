## Why not invest to improve the current health system?
(May be knowing the unknown will help to view the problem from the different perspective.)

We(Asha Nepal, small team) have been working as a part of developing digital health system in rural part of Nepal(Rajpur,
Dang) and it has been 3 months of our implementation of NepalEHR, open source health information system at Rajpur Health Post.

(Until we worked on this project of digitalising the Health post we were unaware of the complexity of the health care systems in Nepal. And made us realize how unaware we are of the Nepalese health system. We had just glimpse of it but many in the society are still unknown about it. As this things are not in books and not taught in schools.)

Some info on the current health system at Rajpur, Dang.

In Rajpur Gaunpalika(situated at the basin of Rapti River, Gorahi Valley)
There are 7 wards, 2 Health Posts, 10 Community Health Units

Currently Health services available:
Rajpur Health Post:
Safe Motherhood(Antenatal Care, Delivery and Post Natal Care), Safe Childhood(Immunization, Nutrition), TB, HIV/AIDS, Family Planning.
OPD, Pharmacy and Clinical Lab. (All this facility provide medicine and services free of charge. )
There are around 40 health staff and 15 Community Health Workers under government. In this health staff there are no any Doctors. So Karma Health, one of the NGO working in public health has placed one Doctor in the Rajpur Health Post and also organise maternal checkup camps(with ultrasound) at various community of Rajpur.

(There is no any X-Ray or surgery facility at the health post. So if diagnosis could not be done, they are referred to Rapti Sub-Regional Hospital, Ghorahi(around 25Km from Rajpur), Bheri Zonal Hospital at Nepalgunj(which is around 125 Km from Rajpur.)

So looking at the current health system, instead of building systems only for Covid, we must look at big picture and make pandemic outbreak control part of the current health system(as there are other pandemic Kala-azar, Dengue, Measles common in this area). There are already so many health programs run by govt. Immunization, Safe Motherhood, TB, HIV so why not for pandemic outbreak control. I don’t know what is stopping the government to take this actions. I think there is no any single solution but solution which can be implemented in the current work force will be better for the long run.
There is already (Digital Health Information System)DHIS system for reporting health care information from every health units to the department of health services. So why government is not using it to monitor health of the society. Instead every municipality, district and even ministry is developing there own health monitoring system only for Covid-19. We are all in it together. We are the different actors of the common system.

I am still new to system, and studying the model of Current Health System of Nepal. But we need holistic solution, we need to add new plan/actors/workflow to solve the problem of pandemic control.
For example, we have health desk at our border checkpoints, and don’t know if they are keeping records of Nepalese returning from abroad. May be like we need to have permanent health/quarantine post at our border checkpoints, which keep the information of their source and target destination and pass the information to the target destination.
(We are small team working to create small changes in the rural health, and need all your help to scale up the system. Implementing in the field is not easy as people does not want to come out of comfort zone and due to lack of digital lieracy. All the software and tools are available in open source just need little push and training for our health staffs. And if you like to implement similar system in your Gaunpalika, District, feel free to connect with us. )
